    "## List of questions:\n",
    "<a href='#Q1'>Q1</a> After I get a trace from Class Finite MP, I use plt.hist and my own trace_distribution() to get the distribution. Any suggestions for my implementation? Why isn't there a method in FiniteMarkovProcess()(An @abstractrclass from rl.markov_process.py) to perform the sampling and ploting task? Do you think it's a good idea for me to add such a method to my RL-book.rl repo?\n",
    "<br><a href='#Q2'>Q2</a> That's my first time to write OOP with python. Are there any design and syntax suggestions to make my code more \"modular\" as stated in grading criteria in syllabus?\n",
    "<br><a href='#Q3'>Q3</a> in rl.stock_price.py process1_price_traces() is defined as an independent function rather than a public method of the MRP class. May I know why? To me, this is a useful functionality that should be part of the class. That's also why I define the simulated value function a public method in my implementation. \n",
    "<br><a href='#Q3'>Q4</a> For this assignment, I only write a public method to return the value function of one given state. If we want to simulate the value of function of a range of states for an infinite MRP, I personally think a value-table that allows us to store and reuse value of previous state very helpful.\n",
