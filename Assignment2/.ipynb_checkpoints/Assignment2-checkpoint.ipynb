    "<a href='#Q1'>Q1</a> After I get a trace from Class FMP, I use plt.hist and my own trace_distribution() to get distribution. My solution doesn't look efficient enough to me. Why isn't there a method in FiniteMarkovProcess() class to perform the sampling and ploting task? Any suggestions for my implementation?\n",
    "<br><a href='#Q2'>Q2</a> That's my first time to write OOP with python. Are there any design and syntax suggestions to make my code more \"modular\" as stated in grading criteria in syllabus?\n",
    "<br><a href='#Q3'>Q3</a> I create the interface StockPriceMP1(MarkovRewardProcess[StateMP1]) and definition of transition_reward() method is required due to inheritence. Do I still need to specify method transition_reward() as @abstractmethod, since it's already stated in MarkovRewardProcess interface? \n",
